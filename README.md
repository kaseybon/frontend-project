# Frontend Project

## Project Overview

Take a product grid from an ecommerce website and recreate it. Try not to look at their code and instead think about how you would build it. Make any improvements to the design and structure you think are necessary.

## Progress

I chose to rebuild the [Etsy](http://etsy.com) product grid.

## Notes

* The custom grid system uses [eq.js](https://github.com/Snugug/eq.js) for element queries instead of relying on media queries.
